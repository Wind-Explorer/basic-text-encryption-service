# way-too-basic text encryption service
a python script to very basic text encryption or decryption

the script uses basic alphabet swap encryption method relying on 8-bit binaries

# how to use
so basically u go releases and download the latest release in pyc format, then run the app to start encrypting and decrypting data!

# my plan for future:
add support to use custom keys for app to refer to when processing data

add support for more variety of signs (for example commas, full stop, exclamation marks are added but some others are yet to have support
